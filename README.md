## Prologue Portfolio

This project is a collaborative effort to make lightweight, nearly ready to deploy portfolios for people in tech who may not be technical or have one. Each shares a few 
common traits: 
- Based on HTML5Up/Skeleton, as described in detail in README.txt 
- Requires no more than light HTML editing to add projects 
- Will be given away at the end of #Hacktoberfest to people without portfolios, with an accompanying blog post demonstrating how to deploy a static site to Github pages
